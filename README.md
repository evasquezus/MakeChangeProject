![](images/register.jpeg)


This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked to enter an item amount. The user then enters the amount.

The program will calculate the change returned by largest denomination. For example: 
If the total cost of the item is 10$ and the total tendered amount from the customer is 12$
The total change would be displayed in the currency ranging from pennies up to twenty dollar bills
